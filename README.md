Given a time and a location predict the type of crime occurring in the city of the Bay 

## :flashlight: CONTEXT
“From 1934 to 1963, San Francisco was infamous for housing some of the world's most notorious criminals on the inescapable island of Alcatraz.
Today, the city is known more for its tech scene than its criminal past. But, with rising wealth inequality, housing shortages, and a proliferation of expensive digital toys riding BART to work, there is no scarcity of crime in the city by the bay.”

## :dart: OBJECTIF
Given the Kaggle competition dataset of nearly 12 years of crime reports, predict the category of crimes that occurred in the city by the bay.

## :rotating_light: PURPOSE
Provide insight to police strategists concerning where, and at what times, police patrols should patrol, or maintain a presence, in order to make the best use of resources or to have the greatest chance of deterring or preventing future crimes.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: METHODS
We will be using data analytics and machine learning technologies in order to predict the crime category given location and time. 
Starting by an exploration and a visualization of our dataset, we will try to gain insight about the different types of crimes in the city of the bay. We will then apply different classification algorithms and select the most performing to use as our final model.
